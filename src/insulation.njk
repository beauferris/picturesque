  <!-- PAGE TITLE -->
  <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Insulation Top-Ups</h1>
  <p class="govuk-body">
  Adding insulation to your attic helps keep heat
    inside during winter and outside during summer—making your home cozier, quieter, and more energy-efficient while reducing
    heating costs.
  </p>

  <!-- KEY BENEFITS -->
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why top up your insulation?</h2>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li><strong>Lower energy bills:</strong> Reduce heat loss and improve efficiency—your furnace works less to maintain a steady temperature.</li>
    <li><strong>Cozy comfort:</strong> Fewer drafts and more consistent room temperatures all year round.</li>
    <li><strong>Moisture control:</strong> Correct insulation + ventilation helps limit condensation and ice-dam risk.</li>
    <li><strong>Quieter home:</strong> Added material dampens outside noise.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- WHAT WE DO -->
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we include</h2>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li><strong>Residential Attic Inspection:</strong> We assess existing insulation depth, coverage, air sealing, and thermal gaps.</li>
    <li><strong>Condensation Inspections:</strong> We check for moisture, staining, or mold risk and recommend fixes before topping up.</li>
    <li><strong>Ventilation Inspections:</strong> We verify soffit and roof vent balance to keep your attic dry and efficient.</li>
    <li><strong>Insulation Top-Up:</strong> We add the right material and depth to reach recommended R-values for long-term performance.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- MATERIALS & APPROACH -->
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Materials and approach</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    We use high-quality blown-in insulation (cellulose or fiberglass) for even coverage over joists and hard-to-reach areas.
    Where needed, we air-seal key penetrations (bath fans, light fixtures) before topping up to lock in performance.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    Typical recommended attic levels are in the <strong>R-50 to R-60</strong> range. We’ll measure your current levels and advise
    the ideal top-up to meet targets and maximize savings.
  </p>

  <!-- SIMPLE PROCESS -->
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Our simple process</h2>
  <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
    <li><strong>Inspect:</strong> Attic, condensation, and ventilation review with photos and a clear plan.</li>
    <li><strong>Prep:</strong> Air-sealing and vent baffles where needed to protect performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Top-Up:</strong> Blown-in insulation to reach the recommended R-value.</li>
    <li><strong>Verify:</strong> Final depth checks and clean-up.</li>
  </ol>
