  <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Services</h1>
  <p class="govuk-body">
   
    From liquid rubberized coatings to ice dam prevention, we deliver durable, cost-effective solutions that extend the life of your roof 
    and protect your home or business year-round.
  </p>

  <!-- SECTION 1 -->
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Liquid Rubberized Roof &amp; RV Coatings</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    Liquid rubber coatings create a seamless, watertight barrier over your roof surface—ideal for both flat and low-slope systems, 
    as well as RV roofs. These coatings seal cracks, prevent leaks, and reflect sunlight to keep interiors cooler and more efficient.
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>Extends roof life by sealing joints, seams, and small cracks</li>
    <li>Excellent adhesion to most surfaces—ideal for aging or weathered roofs</li>
    <li>UV-resistant and flexible, adapting to temperature changes without cracking</li>
    <li>Provides long-term waterproofing with minimal maintenance</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    Perfect for both residential and commercial properties, as well as RV owners looking for long-lasting protection 
    and peace of mind.
  </p>

  <!-- SECTION 2 -->
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Residential Ice Dam Removals</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    Ice dams form when melting snow refreezes along roof edges, trapping water and causing leaks inside your home. 
    We safely remove existing ice dams and address the root causes through improved insulation, air sealing, and drainage.
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>Safe, non-damaging steam removal methods</li>
    <li>Prevention through proper insulation and attic ventilation</li>
    <li>Protects shingles, gutters, and fascia from water damage</li>
    <li>Helps maintain indoor comfort and reduce heating costs</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    We also offer preventive maintenance plans to help you avoid future ice dam formation, giving you year-round protection 
    and worry-free winters.
